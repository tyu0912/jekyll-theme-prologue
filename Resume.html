<p>Hi. I’m Tennison and I love working with data. I’m currently a data analyst by day
    and a Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) student by night. I first got interested in data while
    running experiments as a researcher.</p>

<p>In research, a big part of the job is to discern insight from the
    experiments you run and I’ve always found that part to be very interesting. After several years of research,
    I decided to move fully into an analytical role and haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>Now, I use data to help companies find insight whether it be through ad-hoc reporting or long-term data modeling.
    When I’m not crunching numbers, I also like to read, cook, and go on hikes.</p>
